# Ali Alfridawi

**`Electrical Engineering Student at The University of Texas at Arlington`** 

I am a freshman in Electrical Engineering at the University of Texas at Arlington, with strong interests in research, photonics, and signal processing. As I continue developing my programming skills, I’m committed to creating clear, well-structured documentation for both personal and academic projects using GitHub. I am eager to learn, collaborate, and connect with others in engineering and research communities, and I’m open to networking and new opportunities.
